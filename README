This is just a butch of scripts I tend to use with PDFs from scanners.

Figured others might want them, or use them as a basis for their own.

* pdf_interweave - Work round for scanning double sided stack of paper with single sided scanner.
* pdf_shrink - Just shrink the PDF to 300 dpi
* pdf_shrink_grey - Shrink it to 300 dpi and make it grey scale (smaller still)
* pdf_shrink_more - Just shrink the PDF to 150 dpi
